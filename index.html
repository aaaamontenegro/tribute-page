<blockquote cite="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/9/20/s_1027020">
  <p> According to Acts,
  And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
  And all who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name?
  And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?" But Saul increased all the more in strength,
  and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
  </p>
  <cite>— Acts 9:20–22</cite>
